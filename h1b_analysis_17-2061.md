# H-1B Lottery Analysis: New Weighted Selection System (FY2026+)

**SOC Code:** 17-2061 (Computer Hardware Engineers)  
**Metro Area:** San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, CA  
**Last Updated:** December 2024

---

## Executive Summary

Starting with the **FY2026 H-1B cap season** (registrations in March 2025), USCIS will implement a new **weighted selection process** that prioritizes higher-wage applicants. This guide analyzes how the new system affects Computer Hardware Engineers (SOC 17-2061) in the San Jose metro area.

**Key Takeaway:** Applicants at **Wage Level IV** receive **8× the selection probability** compared to Level I applicants.  
Again this is my high level understanding & now an immigartion advice.

## New H-1B Weighted Selection System

### How It Works

The new rule replaces the previous random lottery with a **wage-level weighted selection process**. Each registration is assigned "tickets" based on the offered wage level:

| Wage Level | DOL Percentile | Weight (Tickets) | Selection Advantage |
|------------|----------------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Level IV** | 67th+ | **16 tickets** | Highest priority |
| Level III | 50th (Median) | 8 tickets | High priority |
| Level II | 34th | 4 tickets | Moderate priority |
| Level I | 17th (Entry) | 2 tickets | Baseline |

### What This Means

- A Level IV applicant has **8× the probability** of selection vs. Level I
- A Level III applicant has **4× the probability** of selection vs. Level I
- A Level II applicant has **2× the probability** of selection vs. Level I

## Prevailing Wage Levels: SOC 17-2061 (Computer Hardware Engineers)

### San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara Metropolitan Area

For Computer Hardware Engineers (17-2061) in the San Jose metro area, the estimated DOL prevailing wage levels are:

| Wage Level | Percentile | Estimated Annual Salary Range | Hourly Equivalent |

## Selection Probability Estimates

### Old System (Random Lottery)

- All applicants had equal probability
- With ~470,000 registrations for ~85,000 slots
- **Everyone's probability: ~18%**

### New Weighted System

Assuming typical wage level distribution among H-1B registrants:

| Wage Level | Est. % of Applicants | Weight | Weighted Share | Est. Selection Rate |
|------------|---------------------|--------|----------------|---------------------|
| Level I | 35% | 2 | 70 units (12%) | ~6% |
| Level II | 30% | 4 | 120 units (20%) | ~12% |
| Level III | 20% | 8 | 160 units (27%) | ~25% |
| Level IV | 15% | 16 | 240 units (41%) | **~45-55%** |

### Probability by Wage Level

| Wage Level | Old System | New System | Change |
|------------|------------|------------|--------|
| Level I | ~18% | ~6% | ⬇️ 3× worse |
| Level II | ~18% | ~12% | ⬇️ 1.5× worse |
| Level III | ~18% | ~25% | ⬆️ 1.4× better |
| Level IV | ~18% | **~45-55%** | ⬆️ **2.5-3× better** |

|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| $140,000 | ~$20,000 to Level II | 2× selection probability |
| $165,000 | ~$25,000 to Level III | 2× selection probability |
| $185,000 | ~$10,000 to Level IV | 2× selection probability |

**Even a small salary increase near a threshold can significantly improve lottery odds.**

## Risk Factors

| Risk Factor | Mitigation |
|-------------|------------|
| **Wage Level Misclassification** | Verify with current DOL prevailing wage data |
| **SOC Code Mismatch** | Ensure job duties align with selected SOC code |
