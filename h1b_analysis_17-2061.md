## New H-1B Weighted Selection System

### How It Works

The new rule replaces the previous random lottery with a **wage-level weighted selection process**. Each registration is assigned "tickets" based on the offered wage level:

| Wage Level | DOL Percentile | Weight (Tickets) | Selection Advantage |
|------------|----------------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Level IV** | 67th+ | **16 tickets** | Highest priority |
| Level III | 50th (Median) | 8 tickets | High priority |
| Level II | 34th | 4 tickets | Moderate priority |
| Level I | 17th (Entry) | 2 tickets | Baseline |

### Key Insight

A Level IV applicant has **8× the probability** of being selected compared to a Level I applicant.

## Selection Probability Analysis

### Old System (Beneficiary-Centric Random Lottery)

- All applicants had equal probability
- With ~470,000 registrations for ~85,000 slots
- **Your probability: ~18%**

### New Weighted System (Your Advantage)

Assuming typical wage level distribution among H-1B registrants:

| Wage Level | Est. % of Applicants | Weight | Weighted Share |
|------------|---------------------|--------|----------------|
| Level I | 35% | 2 | 70 units |
| Level II | 30% | 4 | 120 units |
| Level III | 20% | 8 | 160 units |
| Level IV | 15% | 16 | 240 units |
| **Total** | 100% | — | **590 units** |

### Your Probability Calculation

- Level IV applicants represent 15% of applicants but control 40.7% of selection weight (240/590)
- For 85,000 selection slots:
  - Level IV pool receives: ~34,600 selections
  - Level IV applicants: ~70,500 (15% of 470,000)
  
**Estimated Selection Probability: ~45-55%**

### Comparison

| System | Your Probability | Improvement |
|--------|------------------|-------------|
| Old Random Lottery | ~18% | Baseline |
| New Weighted System | **~45-55%** | **2.5× to 3× better** |
